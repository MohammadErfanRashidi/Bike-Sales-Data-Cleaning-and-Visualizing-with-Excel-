# 🚴‍♂️ Bike Sales Data Cleaning & Visualization (Excel Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates **end‑to‑end data cleaning, analysis, and visualization in Excel** using a real‑world style dataset of bike sales.  
The goal was to transform raw, messy data into a clean, structured format and then build **interactive dashboards** to uncover insights about customer demographics and purchasing behavior.

Key questions explored:
- How do **income levels** affect bike purchases?  
- Are there differences in purchasing behavior by **gender** or **marital status**?  
- What role do **education, occupation, and commute distance** play in bike ownership?  
- How do **age groups** compare in their likelihood to purchase a bike?

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Process
Steps taken to prepare the dataset:
- Removed duplicates and standardized inconsistent entries  
- Handled missing values and normalized categorical fields  
- Created calculated columns for **age groups** and **commute distance ranges**  
- Ensured data types were consistent for analysis

## 📊 Visualizations & Dashboard
The cleaned dataset was used to create an **Excel dashboard** with the following insights:
- **Average Income by Gender**: Male vs. Female purchasing power  
- **Marital Status & Purchases**: Comparison of single vs. married customers  
- **Commute Distance vs. Purchases**: How distance influences bike ownership  
- **Education & Occupation Breakdown**: Which groups are most likely to buy bikes  
- **Age Range Analysis**: Young, middle‑aged, and older customers’ buying patterns

## 🔑 Key Insights
- Higher income correlates with a greater likelihood of bike purchase  
- Married individuals showed slightly higher purchase rates than singles  
- Commute distance plays a significant role — customers with **shorter commutes** are more likely to buy bikes  
- Education and occupation categories reveal distinct purchasing patterns  
- Middle‑aged customers (30–60) represent the largest buyer segment
